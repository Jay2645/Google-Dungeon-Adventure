Morning light glows through the {page:kidnapwindow:girl's window}, warming the room.<br/><br/>Worthington's sixteen year old daughter, Chloe Worthington, disappeared the past night, no more than twelve hours ago. She's a student at the elite St. Anthony's private school. Mr. Worthington hands you a {page:kidnapphotoofchloe:photo of Chloe}. "She's never run off before, could she have been taken?"<br/><br/>The room is in good order, {page:kidnapbedmade:bed made} and {page:kidnapbookshelf:bookshelf} tidy. You wander the scene, looking through the {page:kidnapwastebasket:wastebasket} and {page:kidnapcloset:closet} for clues.<br/><br/>"So what do you think?" asks Mr. Worthington anxiously.]]></description>

"Where's Chloe?" he coughs through the pain.<br/><br/>"We were going to ask you the same thing," you say.

"Joseph Crespo."<br/><br/>"What happened here?" asks Mardler.<br/><br/>"Well I was here with my girl, then I heard someone at the door," he says. "Before I could even get a glance through the peephole, someone bashed right through the door. It was a big guy wearing a mask made of a burlap sack. We {page:barkerscuffledforaminute:scuffled for a minute}, but he was unnaturally strong.

    <description><![CDATA["I got it," you say to Mardler, your mind buzzing. Mardler and Joseph listen anxiously for your theory. "We're looking for someone that escaped in their own carriage minutes ago. Whoever did this doesn't live near here, because this crime is too obviously directed towards Chloe. If the kidnapper was after Joseph but they were surprised by Chloe's presence, why kidnap her? The kidnapper was wearing a mask so he could have ran off without Chloe being a problem. The kidnapper has been studying Chloe, and was there the night she left with Joseph, watching from the distance. That's the only way he would know to strike at this location.<br/><br/>"The recent presence of sawdust and formaldehyde left lingering odors. So the kidnapper probably works with wood, judging by the sawdust and use of a hammer or similar tool in his attack. He's a strong man, so he could plausibly have a job that requires manual labor and heavy lifting. But what of the formaldehyde? Formaldehyde is often used as a preservative to keep dead bodies from decomposing before funerals. I'd gamble the kidnapper works with a mortuary, building coffins and using formaldehyde."<br/><br/>Mardler's eyes grow wide. "We saw a coffin carrying carriage when we arrived!"<br/><br/>"Exactly," you say. "What a strange sight to see a carriage in this neighborhood at all. No one would ever detour through here unless they had business. The passing of that carriage matches with the timing of witnesses claiming to here a scream. We need to find that driver."<br/><br/>Joseph scratches his chin and gives you a quizzical look. "You're making a judgment call on this kidnapping based on the how the room smells?"<br/><br/>"It's all we have to work with for now," you respond. "We're going to need to visit some mortuaries."]]></description>

"That's definitely the carriage that went past us on Barker Street."<br/><br/>Three hours had passed since you left Joseph's house with Mardler and began investigating all the nearby mortuaries. Finally you stumbled upon Walker's Mortuary and identified the vehicle that you'd seen earlier that day.<br/><br/>"Who drives this carriage?" you ask Henry Walker, the owner of the establishment.<br/><br/>"Cade is the one that takes that cab out," replies the owner as he rubs his dirty glasses with a dirtier handkerchief. "Cade Brewer. I didn't even realize it was ever gone. He must have left and brought it back without me noticing."<br/><br/>"What can you tell me about Cade Brewer?" you ask.<br/><br/>Walker shrugs. "Not much to tell," he admits. "Cade has always been a loner, never talking to us or nothing. He came here one day looking for work, so I took him in. Seemed like a drifter, said something about losing his old job so he wanted a position here. He's a big fella, a little taller than six feet I'd guess. Short black hair. Dark eyes." The man leans in close and speaks in a muted tone. "To be frank, he's always given me the creeps. Lumbering around and acting all quiet. It's like he relates more to the dead than the living."<br/><br/>Mardler looks over at you and sighs. "So you have no idea where Cade is now? Where could he be?" asks your partner.<br/><br/>Walker scratches the back of his head. "Not the faintest. But feel free to look through his locker and his carriage."]]></description>

He also had a vial of Opiox painkillers, a new variety of drug, that was issued six months ago, at the time of Gander Hill's closing. Gander Hill was renown for utilizing new techniques and medicines, but it shut down due to embezzlement and inner conflict.<br/><br/>"Look at the material that this note was made of. Thick and torn from what looks like a folder, quite possibly a scientist's or doctor's. The blotches on this note are laudanum, a painkiller made of an opium tincture. How does Brewer have access to Opiox, laudanum and chloroform? Because he worked with medicine, and he's still hiding out in the abandoned hospital."]]></description>

You extinguish it and begin to explain. "Brewer ended his last note with, 'Buono fortuna,' Italian for 'good luck.' He also mentioned that the next girl, 'is in for a storybook ending.' He's poking fun at the investigation that Mardler and I conducted yesterday when tracking down Joseph Crespo. We know Brewer knows Joseph is Italian, as he mentioned that in his first note, and somehow he knows about Chloe's book, 'Love of the Sea.' He must have seen Joseph give it to Chloe, and seen Chloe reading it while stalking her. That's the storybook that he's referring to."<br/><br/>"So how does 'Love of the Sea' end?" asks Mardler.<br/><br/>"That's not important," you say. "That's not the ending that he has planned. He's just pointing us towards the sea, or the Thames in this case, or even more specifically, tideway. Tideway is the part of the Thames that's subject to changes in the tide. When we arrived here I noticed it was low tide, which means we have about six hours before high tide. That lands us at Brewer's deadline of 2 o' clock. That's also why he's unsure, because tides can be unpredictable."<br/><br/>"What happens at high tide?" asks one of the younger police officers.<br/><br/>"I can only assume a girl will die," you respond. "She's probably tied up somewhere where the water will rise and submerge her overtime. Delayed drowning."]]></description>

She's tied tightly to pipe protruding from the wall, and she looks to have choked on her own vomit. There are bits of {page:wronghospitalpalepinkishmushroom:pale pinkish mushrooms} on the ground beside her.<br/><br/>"That's Amy Anderson," mutters Mardler as he checks the young woman's pulse.

There's a {page:offensivesmallgoldbracelet:small gold bracelet} on the earthy ground.<br/><br/>Up ahead your keen eyes pick out a small cabin in the woods, dim light glowing from the windows. You motion for the other officers to remain silent as you all approach the rickety hut.<br/><br/>You're ten yards from the shack, remaining in the shadows, when you hear the loud sound of metal jaws wrenching upwards and the sickening noise of crunching bone and flesh. Yates howls in pain and drops to the ground, clutching his wounded leg, trapped in a large bear trap.<br/><br/>Your eyes dart between the injured officer and the cabin, and you can make out motion inside. Is this him, Cade Brewer? Mr. Burlap himself?<br/><br/>You and Mardler run towards the cabin as Henderson tends to the wounded. Mardler kicks in the door and pulls out his pistol, only to be stopped cold by a swinging shovel to the nose.

"I understand now, that's the cycle he was talking about."<br/><br/>"I don't get it," mutters Mardler, rubbing his dizzied skull and trying to fight a powerful headache.<br/><br/>"Well he's focused on the elements for some reason. He used mushrooms against Amy, so that's earth. Then he used water against Julia. He just tried to choke all the air out of me. All that's left is fire."<br/><br/>"That could be right," says Henderson. "He's obviously got some sort of obsessive compulsive disorder among other problems, maybe he feels an unquenchable need to theme his murders.<br/><br/>"He said Chloe was already in position to complete the cycle," says Tasha. "Do you think she's strapped to a bomb or something? Something automatic or remote control?"<br/><br/>"I doubt it," you respond. "He's too primitive for that. He's just been using rope and mushrooms for his past crimes, aside from the chloroform. I'm thinking he went back to his old job, the mortuary. He could drug Chloe and throw her in a coffin, then wait for someone to put her through the incinerator to be cremated. Ultimate fire."]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<br/>"The Gander Hill Hospital is officially closing down in a few days," says Jane while running a hand through her flowing blond hair. She always loved that hair. So shiny and golden, shimmering in the light. "I just wanted to thank you for all your help over the past weeks, Cade."<br/><br/>You pop an Opiox pill into your mouth. That leg injury you'd gotten from getting hit by a speeding carriage was still very painful, but Jane had been kind enough to write you a prescription to ease the agony. She even drew a cute little smiley face on the bottle. "Of course, Jane, no problem."<br/><br/>The warmth of the Opiox was already kicking into action. Your body began drifting into painlessness. But it also made you angry sometimes. It gave you angry thoughts. Mean, venomous, horrible thoughts.<br/><br/>But you hadn't acted on those thoughts until that night. That night when you followed Jane home from the hospital. You didn't want her to die, but she had to die. And it felt so right when her warm flowing blood stained your hands as you repeatedly brought your scalpel down on her. Swing after swing. The screams of a fading human life became the squealching of a lacerated corpse.<br/><br/>Squealch. Squealch. Squealch.<br/><br/>And you didn't want to kill her, that's for sure. You liked Jane the most of anyone. But with the hospital dying, she had to die to. It was just something that couldn't be avoided in life. Like when your mom tells you to eat your vegetables and get your sleep. You don't why, but you have to do it.]]></description>
